## Has The Internet Taken Over Me? : A Youtube Comment Analysis Project

## Project Overview

The inspiration for this project stems from a phrase I occasionally use when reflecting on my digital habits: **"the internet has taken over me."** This project aims to explore the validity of this statement by analyzing my YouTube activity over the years. As someone who refrains from social media but considers themselves an avid YouTube user, I will focus on my YouTube data from 2016 to 2024. The goal is to uncover patterns and trends in my interaction with the platform, with a particular emphasis on the evolution of the language and style of my comments.

While the idea might sound cliché at first glance, the project's uniqueness lies in its focus on analyzing **comments**, including the **language**, **emoji usage**, **frequency**, and **key phrases** I favored over the years. Additionally, I'll investigate the relationship between the content I watched and the comments I made, aiming to draw insights into how my YouTube usage may reflect changes in my personality and habits over time.

Ultimately, this project seeks to answer the question: **"Has YouTube shaped me in ways I wasn't aware of?"**

## Objectives:

**My Primary Goals:**

**1-My Comment Analysis Over Time:**
* Investigate the evolution of my language style in comments between 2016–2024.
* Analyze the languages I used for commenting.
* Study emoji usage patterns and their frequency over the years.
* Examine the average frequency of comments per month or year.
* Identify recurring keywords, phrases, or themes in my comments.

**2-My Content-Comment Relationship:**
* Explore how the type of content I watched influenced the tone, style, or frequency of my comments.

**My Secondary Goals:**

* Reflect on how my digital presence and behavior on YouTube may align with broader personality changes over the years.
* Determine whether a tangible connection exists between my comments and the hypothesis that **"the internet has taken over me."**

## Why I am Focusing on Comments?

While video history offers insights into viewing preferences, comments provide a richer lens into personal engagement and expression. By focusing on comments:

* I can analyze how I interact with content, offering a unique perspective beyond mere consumption.
* Comments reflect conscious decision-making, making them a more direct representation of how I adapt to and engage with the internet over time.
* This approach allows for linguistic and behavioral analysis, creating room for deeper interpretation of the data.

## Data Sources and Methodology:

**Data Collection:**

* **YouTube Data Export:** Extracted using Google Takeout, including comment history, watch history, and other metadata.

**Tools and Libraries**
* **Programming Languages:** Python (primary)
* **Libraries:** I will be using needed libraries for data manipulation, data visualization, emoji analysis etc.


**Analysis Pipeline:**

* **Preprocessing:** Clean and structure YouTube data for analysis.

* **Comment Analysis:**

* Linguistic trends: Word frequency, sentiment, and language evolution.

* Emoji trends: Frequency and type analysis.

* **Content-Comment Relationship:**

* Correlate comment trends with video genres or topics.

* **Visualization:** Create visual narratives to illustrate the findings.

## Expected Outcomes:

* A detailed timeline of my YouTube comment evolution, highlighting changes in tone, language, and habits.
* Insights into how content preferences shaped my comments over the years.
* Reflections on whether these patterns support the hypothesis that **"the internet has taken over me."**

## Challenges of This Project:

* Ensuring meaningful connections between comments and viewing history to validate the hypothesis.
* Addressing biases in data, such as inconsistencies in commenting frequency or gaps in the dataset.
