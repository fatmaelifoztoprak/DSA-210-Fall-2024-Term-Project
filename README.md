## Project & Main Motivation Overview

The inspiration for this project stems from a phrase I occasionally use when reflecting on my digital habits: **"the internet has taken over me."** This project aims to explore the validity of this statement by analyzing my YouTube activity over the years. As someone who does not use social media much but considers themself as a good YouTube user, I will focus on my YouTube data from 2016 to 2024. The goal is to uncover patterns and trends in my interaction with the platform, with putting a particular emphasis on the evolution of the language and style of my comments.

While the idea might sound clichÃ© at first glance, the project's uniqueness lies in its focus on analyzing **comments**, including the **language**, **emoji usage**, **frequency**, and **key phrases** I favored over the years. Additionally, I'll investigate the relationship between the content I watched and the comments I made, aiming to draw insights into how my YouTube usage may reflect changes in my personality and habits over time.

Ultimately, this project seeks to answer the question: **"Has YouTube shaped me in ways I wasn't aware of?"**

## Objectives:

**My Primary Goals:**

**1-My Comment Analysis Over Time:**
* Investigating the evolution of my language style in comments between 2016â€“2024.
* Analyzing the languages I used for commenting.
* Studying emoji usage patterns and their frequency over the years.
* Examining the average frequency of comments per month or year.
* Identifying recurring keywords, phrases, or themes in my comments.

**2-My Content-Comment Relationship:**
* Explore how the type of content I watched influenced the tone, style, or frequency of my comments.

**My Secondary Goals:**

* Reflecting on how my digital presence and behavior on YouTube may align with my broader personality changes over the years.
* Determining whether a tangible connection exists between my comments and my hypothesis that **"the internet has taken over me."**

## Why I am Focusing on Comments?

While video history offers insights into viewing preferences, comments provide a richer lens into personal engagement and expression. By focusing on comments:

* I can analyze how I interact with content, offering a unique perspective.
* Comments reflect conscious decision-making, making them a more direct representation of how I adapt to and engage with the internet over time.
* This approach allows for linguistic and behavioral analysis, creating room for deeper interpretation of my data.

## Data Sources and Methodology:

**Data Collection:**

* **YouTube Data Export:** I extracted my data using Google Takeout, including comment history, watch history, and other metadata.

**Tools and Libraries**
* **Programming Languages:** Python (primary)
* **Libraries:** I will be using needed libraries for data manipulation, data visualization, emoji analysis etc. (pandas, NumPy, Jupiter NoteBook etc.)


**Analysis Pipeline:**

* **Preprocessing:** Cleaning and structuring YouTube data for analysis.

* **Comment Analysis:**

* Linguistic trends: Word frequency, the language I prefered (English/Turkish), and language evolution.

* Emoji trends: Frequency and type analysis.

* **Content-Comment Relationship:**

* Correlating comment trends with video genres or topics.

* **Visualization:** Creating visual narratives to illustrate the findings.

## Expected Outcomes:

* A detailed timeline of my YouTube comment evolution, highlighting changes in tone, language, and habits.
* Insights into how content preferences shaped my comments over the years.
* Reflections on whether these patterns support the hypothesis that **"the internet has taken over me."**

## Challenges of This Project:

* Ensuring meaningful connections between my comments and viewing history to validate the hypothesis.
* Addressing biases in data, such as inconsistencies in my commenting frequency or gaps in the dataset.

## My Outcomes: ##

**1-Word Usage:** Most frequent words were functional (e.g., "I," "you," "and") rather than topic-specific, which limited the expected insights.

**2-Language Evolution:** Over time, comments evolved from casual/slang-like ("i dunno") to more refined and mature language.

**3-Emoji Trends:** Earlier comments used descriptive words for emotions (e.g., "random"), while later comments adopted emojis (e.g., ðŸ˜Š) for clearer emotional expression.

**4-Language Preferences:** Comment language (English, Turkish, occasionally Russian) reflected the type of content I engaged with during different years.

**5-Content Trends:**
* My interests shifted over time:
* 2016-2017: Experiment videos, Barbie games.
* 2017-2018: Anime, League of Legends, minecraft, cultural videos.
* 2019-2020: General gaming content,minecraft.
* 2020-2022: Among Us, PUBG, Korean culture, different kind of games, minecraft.
* 2022-2024: Game developers videos, gaming videos, minecraft.
  
**6-Insights:**
* While specific word patterns didnâ€™t reveal strong connections to personal growth, the overall analysis highlighted linguistic development, evolving interests, and subtle internet influences on personality.
